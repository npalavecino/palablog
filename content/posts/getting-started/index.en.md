# Why I Decided to Build My Personal Brand as an Engineer on the Path to Executive Leadership  
✨ *Subtitle: How writing, technology, and leadership became tools to think, grow, and connect*

For a long time, I believed that my work spoke for itself. That if I did things right, results would follow. That recognition would naturally come from solving hard problems, being efficient, and keeping systems running without failure.

That mindset worked for most of my engineering career. Until it wasn’t enough.

## 🚧 The Turning Point

At some point, while leading infrastructure, QA, and SRE teams, I realized that knowledge alone isn't enough. To have a real impact within an organization — and eventually across an industry — you need to communicate, inspire, and connect.

Sometimes you're chosen to lead not because you're the most technical, but because people trust you.  
And trust is also built through visibility, empathy, and purpose.  
By showing how you think, what you value, and why you do what you do.

That’s when a question started to follow me around:

> **How can I use my voice to contribute, grow, and create real opportunities — for others and for myself?**

## ✍️ Why I Started Writing

This blog started almost like therapy: I needed to organize my thoughts, record my learnings, and find my own narrative. What I discovered went deeper.

**Writing forces me to think better.**  
It helps me spot patterns, repeated mistakes, strategic wins.  
It makes me aware of the journey, not just the milestones.

And more importantly: it connects me with others.  
With people who might be facing the same dilemmas, who want to build something, who feel they have more to offer — but don’t know where to begin.

> Writing became part of my professional growth.  
> It’s not personal branding for attention — it’s public reflection with intention.  
> I’m being vulnerable, stepping outside my comfort zone, and hey, welcome haters :).

## 🚀 Building My Personal Brand (without selling smoke... or snake oil)

"Personal brand" can sound hollow or self-centered. But to me, it’s simple:

> **Being recognizable by what I value and how I act.**

I want anyone who works with me, reads this blog, or watches a talk I give to know that:

- I believe in principle-based leadership.  
- I’m passionate about building scalable teams that care about their environment.  
- I value continuous learning, transparency, and systems thinking.  
- I don’t have all the answers — but I’m always searching for the right questions.

Today, my personal brand is fueled not only by my technical background, but also by my hobbies, travels, favorite books, mistakes, and doubts.

Because I don’t want to be just a *“cloud-savvy engineer.”*  
I want to be an executive who understands people, systems, and purpose.

## 💡 What You Can Expect from This Blog

This isn’t a course or a success manual. It’s a logbook.  
And here I’ll write about:

- Technology and tech leadership: SRE, QA, observability, automation, etc.  
- Team culture: how I work with Chile and India, how I lead in hybrid, multicultural contexts.  
- Growth mindset: insights from books, failures that shaped me, challenges around performance and purpose.  
- Personal branding: how to share what I learn without sounding like I’m fishing for applause.  
- Travel, coffee, and sports: because growth also happens outside of work.

## 🌱 Why Now?

Because I’m at a stage where I want to move into executive roles.  
Not for the title — but to drive systemic and meaningful impact.

And to get there, I need to develop skills that go beyond the technical:  
**communication, influence, vision, and strategy.**

> This blog is part of that training.  
> My mental gym.  
> My way of staying true to the *why*, while navigating the *how*.

## 🙏 Thanks for Being Here

If you made it this far — thank you.  
I truly appreciate your time and attention.

If anything you read resonated with you, I’d love to talk, debate, or simply exchange ideas.

Building a personal brand is not about oneself.  
It’s about contributing to the ecosystem, sharing what you believe is worth saying.  
And if that sparks a conversation — then it’s already worth it.

**See you in the next post.**
